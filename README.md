# AAIC-Notes


These are my personal notes, feel free to use them for your reference. The notes are incomplete at a lot of places and contain profane words because I want to stay entertained while making these notes. I've also skipped a lot of content that I remember or know about. Consider using these for revision, not for learning. Go buy the course for the complete experience, this is a fraction of the knowledge. I'm not sponsored by them, this is genuine appreciation. 



About the course: Applied ML Course

It has more content and rigor than any other ML course out there. If you're going to do just one course, choose this one. Thank you Srikanth Sir and team for all your knowledge!
